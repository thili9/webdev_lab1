  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hi, I’m [Your Name], and I’m really excited to be part of this Fundamentals of Web Development course. I come from a non-technical background, but I’ve always been fascinated by the way websites are created and how they shape our online experiences. That curiosity is what brought me here.

I’m someone who enjoys learning new things and challenging myself, and web development feels like the perfect mix of creativity and logic. My main goal during this course is to build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I can start creating my own websites from scratch. I’m also interested in eventually working remotely in this field—maybe even taking on freelance projects once I gain more confidence.

This journey is more than just about picking up a new skill—it’s about opening up new opportunities for myself. I’m looking forward to growing step by step and seeing where this learning path leads.</p>
